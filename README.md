## Package Control Installation

The plugin is already submitted to the [Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control) repository and should be included soon. Until then you can easily add a custom repository with the following address: `https://github.com/Chris---/LaTeX-cwl.git`.

### Windows
